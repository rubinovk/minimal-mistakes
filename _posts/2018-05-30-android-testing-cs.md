A couple of years ago (in 2016 to be precise) myself and prof. Luciano Baresi have asked ourselves this question. What followed was a thorough study of the Android testing landscape with its hills and ditches. 

The comprehensive overview of our thoughts and opinions from back then, has been recently [published](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8352077/) in the Computer Magazine. If you don't have access beyond the paywall, simply reach out and I'll be glad to discuss them with you. 

The top items in the article are about testing for and with: 

* Multiple devices
* Lifecycle and system interactions 
* Context-awareness and sensor data
* Dynamic UIs (read Fragments)
* Complex UI interactions
* Inter-app interactions
