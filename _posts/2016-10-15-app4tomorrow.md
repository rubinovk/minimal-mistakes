I want to share my excitement about an innovative course I had a privilege to
co-teach. The ["Samsung App Academy - App4Tomorrow
edition"](http://www.mip.polimi.it/it/news-eventi/news/samsung-app-academy-app4tomorrow-edition/)
is a fruit of labor of Filippo Maria Renga and his team. It's a product of
_Samsung Italy_, in collaboration with _MIP Politecnico di Milano Graduate
School of Business_ and the _Department of Electronics, Computer Science and
Bioengineering_ of the Politecnico di Milano.

The innovative nature of the course is that (apart from helping recent
graduates to acquire the latest digital-world skills, being highly intensive
and practice-driven) the course was propelled by an __audacious goal -- students
had to demonstrate their training by developing real projects of social
significance and impact in collaboration with industry partners__.  Student
were not working on abstract course projects, nope. Instead they had to
collaborate with local businesses to deliver real-world apps to address the
business and societal needs.

As an instructor, the biggest challenge of this course was to teach young
graduates to design mobile applications __regardless of their previous education__.
Most of the students came in without any technical background, yet with
tremendous motivation.

In the course of four months the students were introduced to the world of
__object-oriented programming__ and __Android app development__. They had to grasp
basic and advanced programming concepts (Java, mobile operating systems,
graphical user interface design, databases, etc.) in a course of few weeks, and
sometimes days. 

__And guess what? They delivered!__

A couple of examples: _Petruzzelli Theater_ has a new mobile look.  _Hospital
San Lazzaro_ received a mobile solution to help patients tracking their
therapies. Another app shows real-time data about obstacles for accessing
public spaces for handicapped. 

Very proud of each and all of them!
