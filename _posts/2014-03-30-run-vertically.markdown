I'm no runner myself, however, once I received an essential
lesson about running.  My cousin Alex told me - "Don't run vertically, run
forward!"

-- "What do you mean _forward_? How else can one run? Don't I run forward
already?"
In the next two minutes with very little effort I could perceive what he meant.

<!-- more -->

-- "You don't just push upward. Focus on getting further forward with every kick."
This was very easy to try. And it felt sooo different! I could feel the air
moving against my face and shoulders even though I was jogging! This felt
very different and new. 

There is one difficulty to this technique. It has to be remembered. If you're
a dilettante runner like myself, then by default you don't think about this
'trick' and consequently you don't use it. It requires continuous mental effort
to remember that you need to keep pushing forward. If not - you just forget doing that.

I believe that the same principle applies to my daily work: each action can
push me and those with me forward in a perceivable movement. And the same
difficulty applies too: if I don't think actively about pushing forward, then I
may work without moving anywhere, jump on the same place, googling some useful
stuff, for instance. 

I am convinced that with enough exercise "pushing forward" becomes a mental
habit. Needless to say, some work is needed.

P.S.: Try pushing forward when walking, it works.
