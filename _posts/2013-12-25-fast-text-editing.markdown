I use [Vim](http://www.vim.org) for text manipulation and I quite like
it. Anything from Java source code to LaTeX text can be manipulated with
the speed of thought.

The [configuration](https://github.com/rubinovk/.vim/blob/master/vimrc)
of Vim (.vimrc and submodules) that I constantly update is available on
[github](https://github.com/rubinovk/.vim).

It is mostly a compilation of the best knowledge from the WEB, including
great tutorials by [Derek Wyatt](http://derekwyatt.org/), [Drew Neil
(vimcasts.org)](http://vimcasts.org/) and many more. Get a good general
reference at
[Nettuts](http://net.tutsplus.com/articles/web-roundups/25-vim-tutorials-screencasts-and-resources/).
