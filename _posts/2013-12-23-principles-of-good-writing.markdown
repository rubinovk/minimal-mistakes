This page visually summarizes the most important principles of clear and
coherent writing (that I have learned so far). The best use of this page is
as a memorable checklist.

A print-friendly copy is available [here]({{ base_path }}/assets/files/writing-printf.pdf).

The content on this page inspires from a [resource on scientific
writing](https://cgi.duke.edu/web/sciwriting/index.php) by Nathan
Sheffield. Go check it out! It contains concise and clear introduction
to the principles of a good scientific writing with real examples.
