### > finalizing my project on issues and challenges in Android app development and testing

These apps are getting quite complex and their quality and reliability should not be
dismissed.  My current focus is on issues of quality for dynamic/adaptive user
interfaces (think Android Fragments), multi-modal user interactions (combinations of touch,
accelerometer, sound, etc.), and complex event/reactive app nature

### > my simple Android app ["InEx"]({{ base_path }}/inex/) is getting traction 

Within the first month after release, InEx has acquired __only 5 star reviews__, and
made Future Zooming (myself) recognized as a __Top Developer__ on Google Play.
InEx is now serving over 1700 users.
