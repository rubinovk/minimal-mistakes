Don't hold your breath anymore. 
<a href='http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.futurezoom.inex' target='_blank' style="font-family: 'Lobster', cursive;">InEx</a>
 is a minimal Android app that will
help you to track your breathing sessions and see how you progress with time.

![InEx Android app]({{ base_path }}/images/inex-feature-image.png){: .align-center}

<a href='http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.futurezoom.inex' target='_blank' style="font-family: 'Lobster', cursive;">InEx</a>
 is specifically designed with the [Wim Hof Method](http://www.wimhofmethod.com)[^1] (WHM) in mind, where you perform rounds
of inhalations/exhalations followed by the retention of breath. The app is not limited to this method only and is applicable to the other breathing techniques of your liking.
{: .text-justify}

Designed with a __darker, low brightness__ styling -- it can be comfortably used both during the day and night.
The screen stays on during breathing sessions shielding your concentration.
Simple graphs show how you progress over time and the details of each breathing session.
{: .text-justify}

The button for stopwatch and time display are __big__ and provide subtle touch feedback (when breathing you can be dizzy so it's easier to find big buttons).

<a href='http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.futurezoom.inex' target='_blank' style="font-family: 'Lobster', cursive;">InEx</a>
 has a built-in __autosave__ feature for the stopwatch -- it saves your retention times automatically. And, of course, later you can study and modify the numbers.
{: .text-justify}

__The app is 100% free. No ads. No tracking.__[^2] I developed this app for myself and for people like me who appreciate simple and non-intrusive design.
It's my pleasure to share it with you. Enjoy!

__P.S.:__ If you like the app (honestly) and find it useful, feel free to get me a cup of coffee (I love coffee). With enough coffee I'll stay up late at
night and implement new features. I promise.
