Hi there, this is Konstantin

## I am into

 - thinking hard and developing ideas (disguised as software engineering research and PhD)
 - breaking software (being a software testing professional with an industrial experience)
 - SSS (Surfing, Snowboarding, Slacklining)

## I believe that

* a person inside a car has the same importance as a person outside a car
* digital devices will become more tactile; as of today, they do not measure up to how much we, humans, appreciate touch
* we will find ways to represent the dynamic nature of a computer program statically <!-- ; no information loss -->
* web design will be about design and not about tweaks 
* thoughts are tangible 

## My superpower

> Ability to form a mental image of things intangible;
> in my mind I can visualize and manipulate almost anything tangible and intangible, including music, algorithms, movement of a planet, and, of course, just plain odd situations.

### What is your superpower?
