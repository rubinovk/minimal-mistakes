Hi there, this is Konstantin

I am a software engineering researcher, software testing connoisseur, Ex-Motorolan, and an occasional surfer

## A sample of *what I believe*

* a person inside a car has the same importance as a person outside a car
<!-- * physical interfaces for digital devices will change to become more tactile. Keyboards and touchscreens are good solutions for today, but they do not measure up to how much we, humans, appreciate touch -->
* we will find ways to represent the dynamic nature of a computer program statically <!-- ; no information loss -->
* web design will be about design and not about tweaks 
* thoughts are tangible 

## My superpower

> In my mind I can visualize almost anything tangible and intangible, including music, algorithms, movement of a planet, and, of course, just plain odd situations.

### What is your superpower?
